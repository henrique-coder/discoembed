    A dynamic site made in Flask that is able to generate intelligent embeds without any limitations from almost any video on Discord.
</p>

<br>

#### Features

- The website generates a video player with the direct video url you provide in the Discord preview. It's useful for people who don't have Nitro and want to send very large videos to other people quickly and easily.

#### How to use

Basically, the site has a main base url and 4 parameters, 1 of which is required. The parameters are used to generate the embed with the video player and the thumbnail image you want to use (warning: the site will only send a valid response to the bot that Discord uses to display the player to the end user).

- Base API URL: https://discoembed.vercel.app/v1

Parameters:

- **`url`** (required): the direct video url you want to generate the embed _(H265/HEVC encoded videos or MKV files are not supported)_.
- **`cover`** (optional): the thumbnail image you want to use in the embed _(It must be a direct image url)_.
- **`width`** (optional): the width of the video player _(Default is 1920)_.
- **`height`** (optional): the height of the video player _(Default is 1080)_.

#### How was it done?

- Built with [Python](https://www.python.org)
- Uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) as the web framework

#### Prerequisites
